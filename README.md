# horiseonChallengeCode

## Description
This is a webpage for an imaginary company called "Horiseon" 
I was given the starting code and then was tasked to work through it and clean it up

For the assignment I added comments, cleaned up the style.css file a bit, renamed some elements in the HTML to help with accessibility etc.

It was useful to see how well I could decipher given code to see how it works, and learn how to implement best practices and clean up some unnecessary lines of code in the css file. It also pushed my problem-solving skills because the index.html file refused to work on github pages!
